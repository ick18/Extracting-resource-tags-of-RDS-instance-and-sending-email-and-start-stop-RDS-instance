Managing RDS Instances Using Tags
This project demonstrates how to automate the management of Amazon RDS instances using resource tags. The project includes the following functionalities:

Extracting Resource Tags
Sending Summarized Email
Starting and Stopping RDS Instances Using Tags
Extracting Resource Tags
The extract_tags.py script utilizes the Boto3 library to extract tags associated with Amazon RDS instances. It lists all RDS instances and their associated tags, which can be useful for monitoring and reporting purposes.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
python extract_tags.py
Sending Summarized Email
The send_email.py script uses the Boto3 library to send a summarized email containing information about the RDS instances and their tags. This script can be scheduled to run at specific intervals to provide regular updates.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
python send_email.py
Starting and Stopping RDS Instances Using Tags
The start_rds.py and stop_rds.py scripts demonstrate how to start and stop Amazon RDS instances based on specified tags. These scripts can be used in AWS Lambda functions to automate the start and stop processes at specific times.

Start RDS Instances
The start_rds.py script starts RDS instances based on the start tag with the value yes.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
python start_rds.py
Stop RDS Instances
The stop_rds.py script stops RDS instances based on the stop tag with the value yes.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
python stop_rds.py
Deployment
Create AWS Lambda functions for starting and stopping RDS instances using the provided scripts.
Set up CloudWatch Events rules to trigger the Lambda functions at specific times.
Ensure that the Lambda functions have the necessary IAM roles and permissions to interact with RDS instances.
Configuration
Before using the scripts, make sure to:

Configure your AWS credentials using the AWS CLI or environment variables.
Update script variables such as regions, tag keys, and tag values as needed.
Dependencies
Boto3 library: Install it using pip install boto3.
